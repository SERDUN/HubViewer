# HubViewer
Client for GitHub

Out test assignment includes:
• Designing UI (it shouldn’t be too complex, but try and avoid making
mistakes)
• Working with API GitHub

The assignment and requirements for its completion:
• The application design should include three screens
• a GitHub login page
• a list of user repositories
• one that allows searching through all GitHub repositories and
outputs the necessary search results.
• Each events’s name and description should be included in list
items
• The code must be neat and clean
• You need to publish the completed assignment to either GitHub or
Bitbucket


It’d be nice if you could also:
• give the application some custom style and add animations,
dialogues, etc.
